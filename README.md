# ServiceNow GraphQL Tutorial

Tutorial on configuring a GraphQL api and hooking it up to UI Builder.

## Version: San Diego

## Getting started

This code covers parts one and two of the following tutorials posted at the SerivceNow Community site:
1. [Setting up and Testing your first GraphQL API Tutorial (Part 1 of 3)](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=891d917adb344d10382a82630596193d)
2. [Querying Data with your GraphQL API Tutorial (Part 2 of 3)
](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=014b8310db8d4510019ac22305961949)

This Tutorial is for someone who (like myself not that long ago) is not quite sure what GraphQL is our how it works or why I would use it in the first place.  I was interested in this technology, so I chose my favorite technique of learning hands-on within the context of ServiceNow.

We will explore the basics of GraphQL by implementing an actual API to retrieve Incidents for a University's Students using the ServiceNow platform.  To test it we will setup a third-party client and I will show you how to configure it to get it running.  

**NOTE:** Part three of the tutorial, which is coming soon, will cover using the API to present data from a UI Builder (UIB) page and is contained in a [separate Github repository](https://github.com/ServiceNowNextExperience/graphql-uib-resource-tutorial).
