Tutorial on configuring a GraphQL api and hooking it up to UI Builder.

## Version: San Diego

## Getting started

This code covers the code for the GraphQL API tutorials posted at the SerivceNow Community site:
1. [Setting up and Testing your first GraphQL API Tutorial](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=891d917adb344d10382a82630596193d)
2. [Querying Data with your GraphQL API Tutorial](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=014b8310db8d4510019ac22305961949)
3. [Using Data from your GraphQL API in UI Builder](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_article&sys_id=3e86ca6b1ba05550cd3b33bc1d4bcb8e)

This Tutorial is for someone who (like myself not that long ago) is not quite sure what GraphQL is our how it works or why I would use it in the first place.  I was interested in this technology, so I chose my favorite technique of learning hands-on within the context of ServiceNow.

We will explore the basics of GraphQL by implementing an actual API to retrieve Incidents for a University's Students using the ServiceNow platform.  To test it we will setup a third-party client and I will show you how to configure it to get it running.  In the final article of the series we will demonstrate how simple it is to query data and render it on a page using UI Builder.
